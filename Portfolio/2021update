# I.Teaching and Primary Duties

## Summary

This year, my teaching and primary duties have been Superior.

Student evaluations showed consistent high scores across the five standard questions on the Purdue Evaluation in both Spring and Fall 2020. .

I continued to improve integration of Learner Management Software into classes, especially JOU 3002 and JOU 1000.

### COVID-19 Educational Changes

Syllabi and course materials continue to evolve. This year, students in JOU 3002 worked with content management systems, social media networks, and regularly posting to these platforms along with D2L. We have done assignments requiring annotations in addition to creating blog posts, photo slideshows, timelines, maps, audio and video. I have also transitioned away from teaching the technology of multimedia and toward the practical underpinnings, which has allowed students to develop their solution-seeking skills more in addition to showcasing more student work during class time.

### Assessments

This year I served on the division curriculum committee as we discussed revisions to classes, prerequisites, learning objectives and personnel utilization.

Although some courses have not been offered this calendar year, their presence in the curriculum has stirred interest among students as they expand their educational plans.

# II. Research/Creative Activity

## Summary

My research and creative activity over the past year has been Significant.

In 2018, I continued pursuing a BFA in 2D Studio Art through the Art Department. In Spring 2019, I took sculpture and Asian art history. In Fall 2019, I took Metalsmithing and Figure Drawing III.

Each of these courses helped inform my teaching efforts, as I observed classes both as a student and an instructor. Using these observations, I have continually refined assignments, feedback and classroom management styles.

For the second year, two of my artworks were selected by an outside jury to be displayed in the All Student Show at the Tarble Art Center in March 2019. My painting was selected for an Honorable Mention Award.

I continued to work with two fellow artists in a studio in downtown Charleston, Gallery 619.

Throughout the year, I continued to follow emerging trends in technology, media and journalism, collecting numerous examples of the changing media landscape that informed both my teaching and further research. Many of these trends are shared in Flipboard magazines under my account (https://flipboard.com/@bmurley2015). I added a collection for news related to social media in preparation for a new course that will be proposed in 2019.

I continue to maintain an online Google spreadsheet of various free content creation tools available to journalists, along with the accompanying weblog I reference for my classes (basicmultimedia.wordpress.com).

# II. Service

## Summary

My service during the 2020 Calendar Year has been Superior

In Fall 2020, I began the most important service effort I have done for the division, serving as the chair for the search committee for a tenure-track Unit A faculty member to teach Photojournalism.

The effort – a challenge in “normal” times – was hindered by a pandemic, technological limitations, bureaucratic confusion, and the significance of this hire in the future of the division.

I continued to serve out the partial term I was elected to as Executive Assistant for UPI-EIU. I meet monthly with the union executive council and members of the wider academic labor community. Travel was restricted throughout 2020, but meetings continued regularly as local, state, and national governments, organizations and communities continued to adjust to the changing reality of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Throughout 2020 I served where asked on School and Department committees, which waxed and waned in frequency according to the larger changes within the university.

Finally, throughout the year I have served as an unofficial resource for other faculty and staff on technical issues with classroom and office computers and online resources. This includes troubleshooting unexpected technology issues, advising on using Office 365 and other campus software, and sharing information about broader technological changes in the industry.
