# I.Teaching and Primary Duties

## Summary

This year, my teaching and primary duties have been Superior. The narrative of my year is summarized as incremental success despite ever-changing obstacles.

Obviously, not all of these obstacles come from EIU. But a number of them do, and I think it well to introduce them into the "record," so to speak.

Institutional Obstacles to Teaching and Primary duties

- multi-year integration of two related but dissimilar academic departments.
- Ever-evolving, severe budget constraints, rearrangements and fund allocation shenanigans.
- Committee Cognitive Overload: The combination of departments into a school with still somewhat distinct branches while keeping in step with contractual obligations and IGPs created a borg-like hive of committee work that was poorly communicated across the school. Keeping track of all the various tangentially-related academic jargon *in addition to* course preparation and facilitation was a monumental cognitive load placed on a limited, already overcommitted faculty/staff/chair.
- Push toward LMS integration: This actually began when we moved away from Blackboard to Desire2Learn (D2L). There have been repeated efforts to grow faculty implementation and use, but success levels vary across many variables. **That push was exponentially increased when the Pandemic hit in March 2020.**
- Ever-evolving Equipment Constraints: These are interrelated, but all evolve around rapid technological change, investment in maintenance, life-cycle, changing student access to various technological tools. For instance, what once required a tape or disc to capture onto a video camera can now be done via Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other means. Quality has been slowly democratized, but at the cost of complexity. Add to that ever-evolving external IT restraints and I am amazed there's a class every time one happens.

All of which means that there is an enormous amount of personal pedagogical adaptation that is not immediately evident in standard measurement criteria. So here I include the requested data, but add that the reality is much richer.

Student evaluations showed consistent high scores across the five standard questions on the Purdue Evaluation in both Spring and Fall 2020. These scores show a consistent and intentional increase over the past years.

I continued to improve integration of Learning Management Software (LMS) and associated web applications into course structures, especially JOU 3002 and JOU 1000.

  ### COVID-19 Educational Changes
Syllabi and course materials continue to evolve. This year, students in JOU 3002 worked with content management systems and (separately) social media networks, and regularly posting to these platforms, as well as keeping up with D2L/Office 365 and Zoom. We have done assignments requiring annotations in addition to creating blog posts, photo slideshows, timelines, maps, audio and video. I have also transitioned away from teaching the technology of multimedia and toward the practical and theoretical underpinnings, which has allowed students to develop their solution-seeking skills more, in addition to showcasing more student work during class time.

  ### Assessments

This year I served on the division curriculum committee as we discussed revisions to classes, prerequisites, learning objectives and personnel utilization.

Although some courses have not been offered this calendar year, their presence in the curriculum has stirred interest among students as they expand their educational plans.

This has thrown additional challenges into our ability/need to assess certain core classes according to our standard scales. I am currently participating in several efforts to better understand so-called "alternative scoring" methodologies - many spurred on by the Pandemic.

# Student Advising

The Division transitioned to a single adviser this year, so I continued to advise students who came to me and assisted in their transition to the new system.

# II. Research/Creative Activity

## Summary

My research and creative activity over the past year has been Significant.

I continued to work with two fellow artists in a studio in downtown Charleston, Gallery 619, which I concluded in December 2020.

I continued progress toward a BFA in 2D Studio Art through the Art + Design Department at EIU. My courses have been obviously hampered by the Pandemic situation, but I was able to complete courses in Spring 2020 (Computer Art I and Painting VI) and Fall 2020 (Computer Art, Painting V).

These courses have provided me with a broad base of knowledge that I've used to expand my research in Journalism and Media Literacy. I am currently investigating ways to use this interdisciplinary knowledge through digital humanities platforms. I have had the opportunity to informally work with various academics across campus and, indeed, the world through research and creative class projects. These connections allowed me to find additional resources for Journalism pedagogy, including design, photography, color theory, semiotics, philosophical and political movements and historical context.

I concluded my term as an Illinois Humanities Road Scholar in 2020, although I officially only spoke once after the beginning of the Pandemic. The pandemic increased interest in humanities presentations. Other political events further spurred that interest, and my project was not renewed.

However, participation in the project did allow me to work more closely with Illinois Humanities and other organizations with educational and cultural connections. This has allowed me to open the eyes of students to additional avenues in which they might use their communication skills in an ethical manner.

# II. Service

## Summary

My service during the 2020 Calendar Year has been Superior

In Fall 2020, I began the most important service effort I have done for the division, serving as the chair for the search committee for a tenure-track Unit A faculty member to teach Photojournalism.

The effort – a challenge in “normal” times – was hindered by a pandemic, technological limitations, bureaucratic confusion, and the significance of this hire in the future of the division.

I continued to serve out the partial term I was elected to as Executive Assistant for UPI-EIU. I meet monthly with the union executive council and members of the wider academic labor community. Travel was restricted throughout 2020, but meetings continued regularly as local, state, and national governments, organizations and communities continued to adjust to the changing reality of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Throughout 2020 I served where asked on School and Department committees, which waxed and waned in frequency according to the larger changes within the university.

On a university level, I am involved in several committees/organizations that are symbiotic between my union duties and my faculty service duties. This includes Title IX Dispute Training, Legislative Action Committees, higher education planning/coordinating sessions - both local and national.

I'm not going to list all of that here. Suffice to say that the service on the Search Committee and the EIU-UPI executive board has meant I have had an abundance of service over the calendar year.

Finally, throughout the year I have served as an unofficial resource for other faculty and staff on technical issues with classroom and office computers and online resources. This includes troubleshooting unexpected technology issues, advising on using Office 365 and other campus software, and sharing information about broader technological changes in the industry.
