Definitions Assignment
- Choose five of the terms from the list below and write a definition for each one. Each definition must be clearly defined and must be compared to an image from the image collection. Be sure to explain how the image is an example of the term that is being defined.Be sure to define a specific term first then apply the term to a specific example in the image collection. Highlight both the term you are defining and the code of the image you are using by formatting them in a bold font (see example below).
- Many of these terms have not been covered in the course yet so you will need to do a little research in the textbook to find the definitions. Be sure to use your own words and paraphrase what you read. It is very important that you compare each definition with a specific example from the image collection. You do not need to include the picture in your definitions assignment, but you must include the code that is below each image on the image collection web page.

- Definition Rubric

   1. The term must be defined in such a specific way that it cannot be confused with any other word.
   2. Choose any five terms on the list of terms for this section.
   3. Use at least one folder image as an appropriate example for each definition.
   4. Be sure to explain how the example suits the term being defined.
   5. Each folder image used must have its correct code.
   6. Each definition should be no less than 75 words and no more than 120 words.


- Here is an example of a well-written definition:
   - Shangtuxiawenis anillustrated book format that was first seen in the Chinesepopular pressin the early 1300s. The format was newly printed, fully illustrated popular stories and the upper third of each page was used for illustrations. Publishers started the format in an attempt to appeal to as wide of a populationas possible, both the literate elite and the wideeducated general public. Shangtu xiawen was influential on early Japanese picture stories during the Edo Period and many of the conventions of these picture stories were also used in Japan. ImageE2Q0is an example of shangtu xiawen. In this example itshows how the upper third of each page was dedicated to illustrations, and the bottom two-thirds were devoted to text.
