# EWP Proposal Additional Info

These are the 10 artworks I plan to display and discuss in my EWP project. Due to the interwoven nature of the narrative, I've listed them in a way that hopefully emphasizes the relatively narrow scope of this assignment.

We begin at the center of it all, Ryoanji Zen Garden. Ryoanji Zen Garden (kare-sansui), wasestablished by Hosokawa Katsumoto, Ashikaga shogun deputy in 1450. Instructed Zen priest Giten Gensho (5th abbot of Myoshinji) to transform the villa and establish a Buddhist temple ( official temple site history ). Attributed to Soami, (School) painter and landscape artist, Renzai Zen monk, member of Amida Buddha sect. Soami and other painters of the period were influenced by the Chinese Song Dynasty, where Buddhism, Confucianism and Daoism were intermingling. Also designed gardens and paintings at Daisen-in Temple, also in Kyoto. First mention of a garden in its location is from 1680, with a different number of stones.

Ryoanji Zen Garden 1799-present - designed by Akisato Rikyo, built on top of rubble from previously destroyed gardens. Significant discoveries since the 1980s has given much greater historical context to the current temple design (see, e.g. -- Immortals and Sages: Paintings from Ryoanji Temple -- : The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, v. 51, no. 1 Summer, 1993, which includes hanging screens by several artists of eras when the makeup of the garden is uncertain.

Painting of Shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo by Fujiwara no Takanobu (1147-1199), Minamoto was the father of the Kamakura Era shogunate from the Minamoto Clan. He ruled from Kamakura city. However, the Imperial Court was located in Kyoto.

The Great Wave off Kanagawa, full-colour ukiyo-e woodblock print, Hokusai, c. 1829–1832 - Hokusai is considered a fulcrum of Japanese artistic eras and styles. He produced many works in ukiyo-e, a particular form of woodcut/printmaking using ink instead of pigment paints.

Tai-an chashitsu at Myoki-an, Kyoto - design by Sen no Rikyu (known as Rikyu, among other names), Master of the Art of Tea, Japanese tea ceremony. Rikyu associated with Rinzai Zen, and studied Zen at Daitoku-ji temple. A tea master for Oda Nobunaga, then Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

Raku teabowl - symbol of Wabi-Sabi, Sen no Rikyu, Chanoyu master. Hideyoshi would turn on Rikyu, ordering him to commit ritual suicide, which he did within Hideyoshi's Jurakudai palace in Kyoto. Rikyu's grave is in the Daitoku-ji Zen Temple in Kyoto. Hideyoshi would then torture and kill Rikyu's disciple Yamanoue Soji.

Kabuki Play at the Three Great Theaters, a Newly Published Perspective Print (Shinpan uki-e san shibai Kabuki kyôgen no zu), by Utaga Toyoharu (1735–1814), Woodblock Ukiyo-e print by master printmaker Toyoharu, this (and the many variations on the theme) captures the culture and artistic aspects of the Edo Period, when Japan was mostly closed off from the rest of the world.

Red and White Plum Blossoms by Ogata Kōrin, 1712-1716 (Edo Period)

Ryoanji, artistic project by American musician/artist John Cage (1982-1985) - Cage was greatly influenced by the spirit of Zen in Japanese art by artists like Hokusai and
