# A Garden Runs Through It: Ryoanji Zen Garden at the nexus of Japanese Art and Culture

The history of Japanese art is a complex tangle of intersecting people, organizations and activities in conflict and cooperation toward cultural goals. By carefully following the strands of history from a single point in time and space, we can reach insights into a deeper understanding.

To illustrate, I present to you the Ryoanji Zen Garden. Ryoanji Zen Garden (kare-sansui), was established by Hosokawa Katsumoto, Ashikaga shogun deputy in 1450.  Katsumoto instructed Zen priest Giten Gensho (5th abbot of Myoshinji) to transform the villa and establish a Buddhist temple ( official temple site history ). The _Garden_ has traditionally been attributed to Soami, painter and landscape artist, Renzai Zen monk, member of Amida Buddha sect. Soami and other painters of the period were influenced by the Chinese Song Dynasty, where Buddhism, Confucianism and Daoism were intermingling. He is also credited with gardens and paintings at Daisen-in Temple, also in Kyoto. The exact makeup of the original garden is unknown, as historical evidence only exists to a more recent era.

That is because Japan underwent significant policial struggle across all social domains in the years following the garden's origination. So, when we look at Ryoanji Zen Garden in contemporary depictions, we are looking at a garden originally from 1798-1799, designed by Akisato Rikyo. This design was built on top of rubble from previously destroyed gardens. Significant discoveries since the 1980s has given much greater historical context to the current temple design (see, e.g. -- Immortals and Sages: Paintings from Ryoanji Temple -- : The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, v. 51, no. 1 Summer, 1993, which includes hanging screens by several artists of eras when the makeup of the garden is uncertain).

Painting of Shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo by Fujiwara no Takanobu (1147-1199), Minamoto was the father of the Kamakura Era shogunate from the Minamoto Clan. He ruled from Kamakura city. However, the Imperial Court was located in Kyoto.

The Great Wave off Kanagawa, full-colour ukiyo-e woodblock print, Hokusai, c. 1829–1832 - Hokusai is considered a fulcrum of Japanese artistic eras and styles. He produced many works in ukiyo-e, a particular form of woodcut/printmaking using ink instead of pigment paints.

Tai-an chashitsu at Myoki-an, Kyoto - design by Sen no Rikyu (known as Rikyu, among other names), Master of the Art of Tea, Japanese tea ceremony. Rikyu associated with Rinzai Zen, and studied Zen at Daitoku-ji temple. A tea master for Oda Nobunaga, then Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

Raku teabowl - symbol of Wabi-Sabi, Sen no Rikyu, Chanoyu master. Hideyoshi would turn on Rikyu, ordering him to commit ritual suicide, which he did within Hideyoshi's Jurakudai palace in Kyoto. Rikyu's grave is in the Daitoku-ji Zen Temple in Kyoto. Hideyoshi would then torture and kill Rikyu's disciple Yamanoue Soji.

Kabuki Play at the Three Great Theaters, a Newly Published Perspective Print (Shinpan uki-e san shibai Kabuki kyôgen no zu), by Utaga Toyoharu (1735–1814), Woodblock Ukiyo-e print by master printmaker Toyoharu, this (and the many variations on the theme) captures the culture and artistic aspects of the Edo Period, when Japan was mostly closed off from the rest of the world.
